# Welcome!

My name is Isaac Vock and I am a PhD student in the lab of Matthew Simon at Yale University. I plan to host loads of educational material on this website,
mainly about nucleotide recoding RNA-seq (or time resolved RNA-seq), a recently developed set of RNA-seq extensions that I work with. URL: https://isaacvock.github.io/
