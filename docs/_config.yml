# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

title: Adventures in Time Resolved RNA-seq
email: isaac.vock@gmail.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A series of vignettes to teach you everything you could want to know about
  time resolved RNA-seq methods (e.g., TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.). 
  Topics will include what we can learn with these methods, why they exist, how
  to analyze data from these methods, and so much more! I'll also be discussing
  the many extensions of these base methods, such as their scRNA-seq variants, STL-seq
  to assess the kinetics of promoter proximal pausing, TT-TimeLapse-seq to probe nascent
  RNA, and subcellular TimeLapse-seq.  
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
