# Welcome!
This is a compendium of vignettes that will introduce you to an exciting development in transcriptomics: time resolved RNA-seq. In particular, these posts will discuss nucleotide recoding RNA-seq, a class of methods that combines metabolic labeling, unique chemistries, and high throughput sequencing to assess the kinetics of transcription and RNA degradation. These methods come in many flavors (TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.), but analysis and interpretation of the data is identical in all cases. 

## Introduction

[What is Time Resolved RNA-seq](./_pages/intro_1_what_is_RNAseq.markdown). An introduction to RNA-seq and it's most common application, differential expression analysis. Also introduces a key limitation of RNA-seq that time resolved RNA-seq methods aim to address..

## Analyzing Time Resolved RNA-seq

## Extensions of basic Time Resolved RNA-seq

[Transient Transcriptome TimeLapse-seq](./_pages/extensions_1_TT_TL.markdown). An introduction to TT-TL-seq, an improved method to assess transcription with metabolic labeling and biochemical enrichment.
